  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over the last decade, the development of effective treatment approaches for multiple myeloma (MM) has been associated with higher response rates and longer survival. In patients who achieve complete response, several high sensitivity techniques have been studied to assess minimal residual disease (MRD) and detect residual neoplastic cells within the bone marrow (by flow cytometry or molecular biology techniques) or outside the bone marrow (by imaging or circulating disease markers in the peripheral blood). This is of utmost importance, since residual disease can drive clinical relapse. This review focuses on the progress made in the assessment of MRD in MM. RECENT FINDINGS: The achievement of MRD negativity after therapy is considered prognostically important for MM patients, and data from clinical trials and meta-analyses have confirmed that it is strongly associated with better survival. Along with well-known techniques, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), next-generation flow (NGF), and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), other methods such as mass spectrometry (MS) and circulating tumor cells are under study. Intensive treatment regimens at diagnosis can lead up to 70\% of MRD negativity in MM patients, although the current proportion of curable patients is still unknown. Today, clinicians who treat MM deal with MRD assessment in routine clinical practice. Its appropriate use in therapeutic decision making may be the most fascinating and challenging issue to be addressed over the next few years.},

  abstract = {Background Internal tandem duplications in the FLT3 gene, termed FLT3-ITDs, are useful molecular markers in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for patient risk stratification and follow-up. FLT3-ITDs are increasingly screened through high-throughput sequencing (HTS) raising the need for robust and efficient algorithms. We developed a new algorithm, which performs no alignment and uses little resources, to identify and quantify FLT3-ITDs in HTS data. Results Our algorithm (FiLT3r) focuses on the k-mers from reads covering FLT3 exons 14 and 15. We show that those k-mers bring enough information to accurately detect, determine the length and quantify FLT3-ITD duplications. We compare the performances of FiLT3r to state-of-the-art alternatives and to fragment analysis, the gold standard method, on a cohort of 185 AML patients sequenced with capture-based HTS. On this dataset FiLT3r is more precise (no false positive nor false negative) than the other software evaluated. We also assess the software on public RNA-Seq data, which confirms the previous results and shows that FiLT3r requires little resources compared to other software. Conclusion FiLT3r is a free software available at https://gitlab.univ-lille.fr/filt3r/filt3r. The repository also contains a Snakefile to reproduce our experiments. We show that FiLT3r detects FLT3-ITDs better than other software while using less memory and time.

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy characterized by presence of abnormal clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow, with potential for uncontrolled growth causing destructive bone lesions, kidney injury, anemia, and hypercalcemia. Multiple myeloma is diagnosed in an estimated 34\,920 people in the US and in approximately 588\,161 people worldwide each year. OBSERVATIONS: Among patients with multiple myeloma, approximately 73\% have anemia, 79\% have osteolytic bone disease, and 19\% have acute kidney injury at the time of presentation. Evaluation of patients with possible multiple myeloma includes measurement of hemoglobin, serum creatinine, serum calcium, and serum free light chain levels; serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation; 24-hour urine protein electrophoresis; and full-body skeletal imaging with computed tomography, positron emission tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. The Revised International Staging System combines data from the serum biomarkers β2 microglobulin, albumin, and lactate dehydrogenase in conjunction with malignant plasma cell genomic features found on fluorescence in situ hybridization-t(4;14), del(17p), and t(14;16)-to assess estimated progression-free survival and overall survival. At diagnosis, 28\% of patients are classified as having Revised International Staging stage I multiple myeloma, and these patients have a median 5-year survival of 82\%. Among all patients with multiple myeloma, standard first-line (induction) therapy consists of a combination of an injectable proteasome inhibitor (ie, bortezomib), an oral immunomodulatory agent (ie, lenalidomide), and dexamethasone and is associated with median progression-free survival of 41 months, compared with historical reports of 8.5 months without therapy. This induction therapy combined with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation followed by maintenance lenalidomide is standard of care for eligible patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Approximately 34\,920 people in the US and 155\,688 people worldwide are diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year. Induction therapy with an injectable proteasome inhibitor, an oral immunomodulatory agent and dexamethasone followed by treatment with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and maintenance therapy with lenalidomide are among the treatments considered standard care for eligible patients.},

One such predictive biomarker is the mutational status of the variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHV) gene, which is a powerful predictor of duration of response and overall survival with chemoimmunotherapy (CIT). As this test may influence choice of therapy between CIT and novel agents, it is critical that providers understand how mutational status is determined and the limitations of testing. Here, we describe the details of IGHV mutational status testing, highlighting the appropriate way to interpret this information and best apply it to the care of patients with CLL.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The B and T lymphocytes are white blood cells playing a key role in the adaptive immunity. A part of their DNA, called the V(D)J recombinations, is specific to each lymphocyte, and enables recognition of specific antigenes. Today, with new sequencing techniques, one can get billions of DNA sequences from these regions. With dedicated Repertoire Sequencing (RepSeq) methods, it is now possible to picture population of lymphocytes, and to monitor more accurately the immune response as well as pathologies such as leukemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Vidjil is an open-source platform for the interactive analysis of high-throughput sequencing data from lymphocyte recombinations. It contains an algorithm gathering reads into clonotypes according to their V(D)J junctions, a web application made of a sample, experiment and patient database and a visualization for the analysis of clonotypes along the time. Vidjil is implemented in C++, Python and Javascript and licensed under the GPLv3 open-source license. Source code, binaries and a public web server are available at http://www.vidjil.org and at http://bioinfo.lille.inria.fr/vidjil. Using the Vidjil web application consists of four steps: 1. uploading a raw sequence file (typically a FASTQ); 2. running RepSeq analysis software; 3. visualizing the results; 4. annotating the results and saving them for future use. For the end-user, the Vidjil web application needs no specific installation and just requires a connection and a modern web browser. Vidjil is used by labs in hematology or immunology for research and clinical applications.},

  abstract = {Background V(D)J recombinations in lymphocytes are essential for immunological diversity. They are also useful markers of pathologies. In leukemia, they are used to quantify the minimal residual disease during patient follow-up. However, the full breadth of lymphocyte diversity is not fully understood. Results We propose new algorithms that process high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data to extract unnamed V(D)J junctions and gather them into clones for quantification. This analysis is based on a seed heuristic and is fast and scalable because in the first phase, no alignment is performed with germline database sequences. The algorithms were applied to TR γ HTS data from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and also on data simulating hypermutations. Our methods identified the main clone, as well as additional clones that were not identified with standard protocols. Conclusions The proposed algorithms provide new insight into the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data for leukemia, and also to the quantitative assessment of any immunological profile. The methods described here are implemented in a C++ open-source program called Vidjil.

  abstract = {Despite substantial advances in anti-myeloma treatments, early recurrence and death remain an issue in certain subpopulations. Cytogenetic abnormalities (CAs) are the most widely accepted predictors for poor prognosis in multiple myeloma (MM), such as t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), gain/amp(1q21), del(1p), and del(17p). Co-existing high-risk CAs (HRCAs) tend to be associated with an even worse prognosis. Achievement of sustained minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity has recently emerged as a surrogate for longer survival, regardless of cytogenetic risk. Information from newer clinical trials suggests that extended intensified treatment can help achieve MRD-negativity in patients with HRCAs, which may lead to improved outcomes. Therapy should be considered to include a 3- or 4-drug induction regimen (PI/IMiD/Dex or PI/IMiD/Dex/anti-CD38 antibody), auto-transplantation, and consolidation/maintenance with lenalidomide\,±\,a PI. Results from ongoing clinical trials for enriched high-risk populations will reveal the precise efficacy of the investigated regimens. Genetic abnormalities of MM cells are intrinsic critical factors determining tumor characteristics, which reflect the natural course and drug sensitivity of the disease. This paper reviews the clinicopathological features of genomic abnormalities related to adverse prognosis, focusing on HRCAs that are the most relevant in clinical practice, and outline current optimal therapeutic approaches for newly diagnosed MM with HRCAs.},

This process of V(D)J recombination is the major source of the immense diversity of the immune repertoire of jawed vertebrates. The recombinase that initiates the process, recombination-activating genes 1 (RAG1) and RAG2, belongs to a large family that includes transposases and retroviral integrases. RAG1/2 cleaves the DNA adjacent to the gene segments to be recombined, and the segments are then joined together by DNA repair factors. A decade of biochemical research on RAG1/2 has revealed many similarities to transposition, culminating with the observation that RAG1/2 can carry out transpositional strand transfer. Here, we discuss the parallels between V(D)J recombination and transposition, focusing specifically on the assembly of the recombination nucleoprotein complex, the mechanism of cleavage, the disassembly of post-cleavage complexes, and aberrant reactions carried out by the recombinase that do not result in successful locus rearrangement and may be deleterious to the organism. This work highlights the considerable diversity of transposition systems and their relation to V(D)J recombination.},

  abstract = {The antigen receptors, immunoglobulins (IG) and T cell receptors (TR), are specific molecular components of the adaptive immune response of vertebrates. Their genes are organized in the genome in several loci (7 in humans) that comprise different gene types: variable (V), diversity (D), joining (J) and constant (C) genes. Synthesis of the IG and TR proteins requires rearrangements of V and J, or V, D and J genes at the DNA level, followed by the splicing at the RNA level of the rearranged V-J and V-D-J genes to C genes. Owing to the particularities of IG and TR gene structures related to these molecular mechanisms, conventional bioinformatic software and tools are not adapted to the identification and description of IG and TR genes in large genomic sequences. In order to answer that need, IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®, has developed IMGT/LIGMotif, a tool for IG and TR gene annotation. This tool is based on standardized rules defined in IMGT-ONTOLOGY, the first ontology in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics.},

  abstract = {At the 10th Human Genome Mapping (HGM10) Workshop, in New Haven, for the first time, immunoglobulin (IG) or antibody and T cell receptor (TR) variable (V), diversity (D), joining (J), and constant (C) genes were officially recognized as ‘genes’, as were the conventional genes. Under these HGM auspices, IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®, was created in June 1989 at Montpellier (University of Montpellier and CNRS). The creation of IMGT® marked the birth of immunoinformatics, a new science, at the interface between immunogenetics and bioinformatics. The accuracy and the consistency between genes and alleles, sequences, and three-dimensional (3D) structures are based on the IMGT Scientific chart rules generated from the IMGT-ONTOLOGY axioms and concepts: IMGT standardized keywords (IDENTIFICATION), IMGT gene and allele nomenclature (CLASSIFICATION), IMGT standardized labels (DESCRIPTION), IMGT unique numbering and IMGT Collier de Perles (NUMEROTATION). These concepts provide IMGT® immunoinformatics insights for antibody V and C domain structure and function, used for the standardized description in IMGT® web resources, databases and tools, immune repertoires analysis, single cell and/or high-throughput sequencing (HTS, NGS), antibody humanization, and antibody engineering in relation with effector properties.},

  abstract = {The prognostic value of minimal residual disease (MRD) for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated in a large cohort of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) using a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. Medline and EMBASE databases were searched for articles published up to 8 June 2019, with no date limit on the indexed database. Clinical end points stratified by MRD status (positive or negative) were extracted, including hazard ratios (HRs) on PFS and OS, P values, and confidence intervals (CIs). HRs were estimated based on reconstructed patient-level data from published Kaplan-Meier curves. Forty-four eligible studies with PFS data from 8098 patients, and 23 studies with OS data from 4297 patients were identified to assess the association between MRD status and survival outcomes. Compared with MRD positivity, achieving MRD negativity improved PFS (HR, 0.33; 95\% CI, 0.29-0.37; P {$<$} .001) and OS (HR, 0.45; 95\% CI, 0.39-0.51; P {$<$} .001). MRD negativity was associated with significantly improved survival outcomes regardless of disease setting (newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory MM), MRD sensitivity thresholds, cytogenetic risk, method of MRD assessment, depth of clinical response at the time of MRD measurement, and MRD assessment premaintenance and 12 months after start of maintenance therapy. The strong prognostic value of MRD negativity and its association with favorable outcomes in various disease and treatment settings sets the stage to adopt MRD as a treatment end point, including development of therapeutic strategies. This large meta-analysis confirms the utility of MRD as a relevant surrogate for PFS and OS in MM.},

  abstract = {Measurable residual disease (MRD) is the most powerful independent predictor of risk of relapse and long-term survival in adults and children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). For almost all patients with ALL there is a reliable method to evaluate MRD, which can be done using multi-color flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect specific fusion transcripts or immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, and high-throughput next-generation sequencing. While next-generation sequencing-based MRD detection has been increasingly utilized in clinical practice due to its high sensitivity, the clinical significance of very low MRD levels (\&lt;10-4) is not fully characterized. Several new immunotherapy approaches including blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies have demonstrated efficacy in eradicating MRD in patients with B-ALL. However, new approaches to target MRD in patients with T-ALL remain an unmet need. As our MRD detection assays become more sensitive and expanding novel therapeutics enter clinical development, the future of ALL therapy will increasingly utilize MRD as a criterion to either intensify or modify therapy to prevent relapse or de-escalate therapy to reduce treatment-related morbidity and mortality.},
