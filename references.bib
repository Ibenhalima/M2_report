  abstract = {Background Internal tandem duplications in the FLT3 gene, termed FLT3-ITDs, are useful molecular markers in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for patient risk stratification and follow-up. FLT3-ITDs are increasingly screened through high-throughput sequencing (HTS) raising the need for robust and efficient algorithms. We developed a new algorithm, which performs no alignment and uses little resources, to identify and quantify FLT3-ITDs in HTS data. Results Our algorithm (FiLT3r) focuses on the k-mers from reads covering FLT3 exons 14 and 15. We show that those k-mers bring enough information to accurately detect, determine the length and quantify FLT3-ITD duplications. We compare the performances of FiLT3r to state-of-the-art alternatives and to fragment analysis, the gold standard method, on a cohort of 185 AML patients sequenced with capture-based HTS. On this dataset FiLT3r is more precise (no false positive nor false negative) than the other software evaluated. We also assess the software on public RNA-Seq data, which confirms the previous results and shows that FiLT3r requires little resources compared to other software. Conclusion FiLT3r is a free software available at https://gitlab.univ-lille.fr/filt3r/filt3r. The repository also contains a Snakefile to reproduce our experiments. We show that FiLT3r detects FLT3-ITDs better than other software while using less memory and time.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The B and T lymphocytes are white blood cells playing a key role in the adaptive immunity. A part of their DNA, called the V(D)J recombinations, is specific to each lymphocyte, and enables recognition of specific antigenes. Today, with new sequencing techniques, one can get billions of DNA sequences from these regions. With dedicated Repertoire Sequencing (RepSeq) methods, it is now possible to picture population of lymphocytes, and to monitor more accurately the immune response as well as pathologies such as leukemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Vidjil is an open-source platform for the interactive analysis of high-throughput sequencing data from lymphocyte recombinations. It contains an algorithm gathering reads into clonotypes according to their V(D)J junctions, a web application made of a sample, experiment and patient database and a visualization for the analysis of clonotypes along the time. Vidjil is implemented in C++, Python and Javascript and licensed under the GPLv3 open-source license. Source code, binaries and a public web server are available at http://www.vidjil.org and at http://bioinfo.lille.inria.fr/vidjil. Using the Vidjil web application consists of four steps: 1. uploading a raw sequence file (typically a FASTQ); 2. running RepSeq analysis software; 3. visualizing the results; 4. annotating the results and saving them for future use. For the end-user, the Vidjil web application needs no specific installation and just requires a connection and a modern web browser. Vidjil is used by labs in hematology or immunology for research and clinical applications.},

  abstract = {Background V(D)J recombinations in lymphocytes are essential for immunological diversity. They are also useful markers of pathologies. In leukemia, they are used to quantify the minimal residual disease during patient follow-up. However, the full breadth of lymphocyte diversity is not fully understood. Results We propose new algorithms that process high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data to extract unnamed V(D)J junctions and gather them into clones for quantification. This analysis is based on a seed heuristic and is fast and scalable because in the first phase, no alignment is performed with germline database sequences. The algorithms were applied to TR γ HTS data from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and also on data simulating hypermutations. Our methods identified the main clone, as well as additional clones that were not identified with standard protocols. Conclusions The proposed algorithms provide new insight into the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data for leukemia, and also to the quantitative assessment of any immunological profile. The methods described here are implemented in a C++ open-source program called Vidjil.

  abstract = {The genes that encode immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors must be assembled from the multiple variable (V), joining (J), and sometimes diversity (D) gene segments present in the germline loci. This process of V(D)J recombination is the major source of the immense diversity of the immune repertoire of jawed vertebrates. The recombinase that initiates the process, recombination-activating genes 1 (RAG1) and RAG2, belongs to a large family that includes transposases and retroviral integrases. RAG1/2 cleaves the DNA adjacent to the gene segments to be recombined, and the segments are then joined together by DNA repair factors. A decade of biochemical research on RAG1/2 has revealed many similarities to transposition, culminating with the observation that RAG1/2 can carry out transpositional strand transfer. Here, we discuss the parallels between V(D)J recombination and transposition, focusing specifically on the assembly of the recombination nucleoprotein complex, the mechanism of cleavage, the disassembly of post-cleavage complexes, and aberrant reactions carried out by the recombinase that do not result in successful locus rearrangement and may be deleterious to the organism. This work highlights the considerable diversity of transposition systems and their relation to V(D)J recombination.},

  abstract = {The antigen receptors, immunoglobulins (IG) and T cell receptors (TR), are specific molecular components of the adaptive immune response of vertebrates. Their genes are organized in the genome in several loci (7 in humans) that comprise different gene types: variable (V), diversity (D), joining (J) and constant (C) genes. Synthesis of the IG and TR proteins requires rearrangements of V and J, or V, D and J genes at the DNA level, followed by the splicing at the RNA level of the rearranged V-J and V-D-J genes to C genes. Owing to the particularities of IG and TR gene structures related to these molecular mechanisms, conventional bioinformatic software and tools are not adapted to the identification and description of IG and TR genes in large genomic sequences. In order to answer that need, IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®, has developed IMGT/LIGMotif, a tool for IG and TR gene annotation. This tool is based on standardized rules defined in IMGT-ONTOLOGY, the first ontology in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics.},

Under these HGM auspices, IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®, was created in June 1989 at Montpellier (University of Montpellier and CNRS). The creation of IMGT® marked the birth of immunoinformatics, a new science, at the interface between immunogenetics and bioinformatics. The accuracy and the consistency between genes and alleles, sequences, and three-dimensional (3D) structures are based on the IMGT Scientific chart rules generated from the IMGT-ONTOLOGY axioms and concepts: IMGT standardized keywords (IDENTIFICATION), IMGT gene and allele nomenclature (CLASSIFICATION), IMGT standardized labels (DESCRIPTION), IMGT unique numbering and IMGT Collier de Perles (NUMEROTATION). These concepts provide IMGT® immunoinformatics insights for antibody V and C domain structure and function, used for the standardized description in IMGT® web resources, databases and tools, immune repertoires analysis, single cell and/or high-throughput sequencing (HTS, NGS), antibody humanization, and antibody engineering in relation with effector properties.},
